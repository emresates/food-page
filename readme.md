# Food Page
### Today I designed a Food Page with using Html, Scss and Javascript. 

### When you click the toggle button in top-left, fixed navbar pops up. There is an effect like pulling the curtain. 

### There is a variety of food on the homepage that changes every 1 second.

### There is a gallery page. When you hover a photo , lines appear first, then the title and finally the description text.
